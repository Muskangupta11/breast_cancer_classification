# breast_cancer_classification

Motive : To find the best classification model to predict the class of the cancer based on the 9 features (Clump Thickness,Uniformity of Cell Size, Uniformity of Cell Shape, Marginal Adhesion, Single Epithelial Cell Size, Bare Nuclei,Bland Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli, Mitoses)
